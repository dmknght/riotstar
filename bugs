1. Likely container kill didn't work correctly -> remove image doesn't work either. Image is still showing in `docker image ls` and requires force remove. Remove worked fine after full test again
2. When start container, a container failed to start still shows `running` status. Run `show running` again will show real status.
3. For DVWA, it pulls 2 tags so there is still 1 image is on system
